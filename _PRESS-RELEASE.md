# Project Name #
JavaScript - The Little Things
## Heading ##
  <!-- > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand. -->
The little things not covered in tutorials that a developer still needs to know
## Sub-Heading ##
  <!-- > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title. -->
This is for the growing developer who seeks to improve their workflow and quality of life by finding quick answers to tricky problems.
## Summary ##
  <!-- > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good. -->
There is something that almost every tutorial forgets. New developers don't understand some of the trickier cases for higher order functions. They don't know how to reverse a string (you would think string.reverse() would be a function by now.). They don't know how to deeply compare two objects. You get the idea. The Little Things seeks to be an organized repository of information that developers can reference for all sorts of tips and tricks. It seeks to present this info in clear English with examples rather than in the low-level, arcane, and technical speak found in most docs.
## Problem ##
  <!-- > Describe the problem your product solves. -->
Junior developers struggle with little things that an experienced programmer takes for granted. There isn't one place that this information is gathered. Stack Overflow can be too much for junior developers still, and Medium is too hit and miss on accuracy. I haven't found anything else that even comes close for all my searching.
## Solution ##
  <!-- > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem. -->
The Little Things will provide a well organized repository of information that these developers can reference to quickly solve tricky problems.
<!-- ## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next. -->
